With this assignment, we would like to check your skills in PHP or Node.js and Vue js or React.js. You need to create a simple banking system as described below: 
Create a Database named 'Bank' consisting of 2 tables, namely, Users & Accounts. Users table will have all users(bankers & customers). 
Accounts table will have all entries of cash deposited & withdrawn. 

1. Customer login: 
Login page: Will consist of username/email and password fields. 
An access token(a random alphanumeric string of 36 characters) for authorization must be generated with every login. 
That particular access token must be used as a header(Authorization) for every other API request from thereon. 
Transactions Page: Login should take the customer to the transactions page to see all of its transaction records 
along with Deposit and Withdraw buttons. Clicking on either of the buttons should open up a popup showing available 
balance along with a numeric input field to enter the amount for deposit/withdrawal. Withdrawal will deduct &
deposit will add to the balance amount. If the withdrawal amount entered is greater than the balance amount then show a message, 
"Insufficient Funds". 
2. Banker Login: 
Accounts Page: Login should take the banker to the Accounts page to see all the accounts of the customers. 
A banker should be able to click on a particular user to see its transactions. 
This task should be achieved by using the MVC(Model View Controller) Architecture. 
The assignment should take between 2-4 days, the earlier the better. 
You will need to submit your Github repo link or any free live server.
